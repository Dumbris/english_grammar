* Why modal verbs are called modal
** A modal verb is a type of verb that is used to indicate modality – that is: likelihood, ability, permission and obligation
* Is either “can” or “could” more polite

** In English, the past tense FORM of both lexical verbs [jump, run, write, etc] and the Historical past tense FORM of modal verbs are used to perform a number of different tasks: politeness/deference/doubt/non- real or counterfactual/... when it comes to the modals, it is the HISTORICAL past tense FORMS which are used, again, to effect a greater sense of politeness, deference/softness/... It's vitally important to remember that this use is only a use of the past tense FORM, it is NOT a true past tense, in the sense of time, use!!

* shown and showed
** "showed" is the simple past, "shown" is the past participle.
*** _The first TV program shown in Japan was "Tetsuwan Atom"_


* Be Vs Do?
** "To be" refers to a state of being. "To do" refers to an action.
** "He does not care" or "he cares" both refer to how he feels at a particular point in time. Caring or not caring are emotional actions. If you want to talk about a state of being, you could say "he is uncaring." This means he is always that way.
** When the verb in a statement is neither a primary auxiliary verb (be, have, do) nor a modal auxiliary verb (will, would, can, could, may, might, shall, should, must, ought to, used to), do is used is to form a question from it. Thus, ‘You know where my house is’ becomes ‘Do you know where my house is?’
